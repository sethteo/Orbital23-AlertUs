  ### Team name:
AlertUs
  ### Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini

  ### Motivation: 
Our team AlertUS has always tried to be thrifty, seeking the best deals when it comes to items we purchase. However there we face a problem, the prices of items online may go on random sales that customers are unaware of. Thus, customers are unable to take advantage of these sales to buy items they desire at a discounted price. We aim to develop a Telegram bot which would ask users to input the link of an item from local supermarket chains like NTUC and ColdStorage, they would like to track the price for. An alert will be sent to the user whenever it reaches a target price the user sets. This will reduce the time customers waste scrolling through websites finding their products and take advantage of online sales. Hence, creating a more seamless online shopping experience.
Vision: 
Our vision at AlertUS is to improve the online shopping experience by creating a Telegram bot that serves as users' personal shopping guru. Gone are the days of aimlessly scrolling through websites, wasting valuable time in search of the best deals. Our bot will track prices of items from local supermarket chains, such as NTUC and Cold Storage, and notify users when their desired items reach a target price. This proactive approach will enable users to make informed purchasing decisions and seize opportunities to buy their desired products at the best possible prices. Our goal is to save users time, effort, and money by offering a seamless online shopping experience, guided by personalized insights, insider tips, and exclusive offers. With AlertUS, users will have a trusted companion that empowers them to make informed purchasing decisions and enjoy a rewarding shopping journey.
